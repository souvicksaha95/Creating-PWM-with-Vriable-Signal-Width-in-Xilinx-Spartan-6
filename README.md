# Creating-PWM-with-Vriable-Signal-Width-in-Xilinx-Spartan-6
In this project, I created a PWM signal out of an FPGA (Xilinx Spartan 6), in which the PWM width can be altered with a push of a button. That means we can create duty cycle 0 to 100 percent ideally. Along with that, with the push of the other button, the PWM width can be decreased as well. The effect can be seen on led[0] to led[3], which will light up with the corresponding intensity. Also, the current PWM width will be shown in microseconds by a 4x7 segment display. Look for the video (VID_20200420_192551.mp4) in this repository for more clearance.
