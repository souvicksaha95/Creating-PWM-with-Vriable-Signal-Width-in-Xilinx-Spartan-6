# Creating-PWM-with-Vriable-Signal-Width-in-Xilinx-Spartan-6
In this project I created PWM signal out of an FPGA (Xilinx Spartan 6), in which the PWM width can be altered with a push of button. That means we can create duty cycle 0 to 100 percent ideally. Along with that, with the push of an other button the PWM width can be decreased as well. The effect can be seen on led[0] to led[3], which will light up with the corresponding intensity.
